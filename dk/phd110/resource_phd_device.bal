# FHIR PhdDevice resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + note - Descriptive information, usage information or implantation information that is not captured in an existing element.
# + parent - The parent device.
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + distinctIdentifier - The distinct identification string as required by regulation for a human cell, tissue, or cellular and tissue-based product.
# + 'type - The kind or type of device.
# + deviceName - This represents the manufacturer's name of the device as provided by the device, from a UDI label, or by a person describing the Device. This typically would be used when a person provides the name(s) or when the device represents one of the names available from DeviceDefinition.
# + manufacturer - The manufacturer name as reported by the System-Model attribute.
# + statusReason - Reason for the dtatus of the Device availability.
# + patient - Patient information, If the device is affixed to a person.
# + safety - Provides additional safety characteristics about a medical device. For example devices containing latex.
# + contact - Contact details for an organization or a particular human that is responsible for the device.
# + property - The actual configuration settings of a device as it actually operates, e.g., regulation status, time properties.
# * property Slicings
# 1) PhdDevicePropertyCodedListProperties: The device properties represented by a list of codes such as the list of certified PHD or H-FS interfaces
# - min = 0
# - max = *
#
# 2) PhdDevicePropertyQuantitiesProperty: The device properties represented by quantities such as clock resolution
# - min = 0
# - max = *
#
# 3) PhdDevicePropertyBitProperties: Properties reported in BITs fields
# - min = 0
# - max = *
#
# + manufactureDate - The date and time when the device was manufactured.
# + definition - The reference to the definition for the device.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + expirationDate - The date and time beyond which this device is no longer valid or should not be used (if applicable).
# + owner - An organization that is responsible for the provision and ongoing maintenance of the device.
# + identifier - The assigned unique identification of the device that is semantically meaningful outside of the FHIR resource context. An example would be the IEEE EUI-64 System-Id or transport address. For PHDs the systemIdentifier is required and the transportAddressIdentifier is highly recommended as this is what most end users see and can obtain from the device itself or device packaging.
# * identifier Slicings
# 1) PhdDeviceIdentifierBtmacAddressIdentifier: Bluetooth MAC Transport address identifier
# - min = 0
# - max = 1
#
# 2) PhdDeviceIdentifierSystemIdIdentifier: System Id identifier
# - min = 1
# - max = 1
#
# 3) PhdDeviceIdentifierMacAddressIdentifier: MAC Transport address identifier
# - min = 0
# - max = 1
#
# + serialNumber - The serial number as reported by the Production-Specification attribute.
# + lotNumber - Lot number assigned by the manufacturer.
# + 'version - The actual design of the device or software version running on the device.
# + url - A network address on which the device may be contacted directly.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + udiCarrier - Unique device identifier (UDI) assigned to device label or package. Note that the Device may include multiple udiCarriers as it either may include just the udiCarrier for the jurisdiction it is sold, or for multiple jurisdictions it could have been sold.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + specialization - The capabilities supported on a device, the standards to which the device conforms for a particular purpose, and used for the communication.
# + location - The place where the device can be found.
# + modelNumber - The model number as reported by the System-Model attribute.
# + partNumber - The part number as reported by the Production-Specification attribute.
# + status - Status of the Device availability.

Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - A symbol in syntax defined by the system. The symbol may be a predefined code or an expression in a syntax defined by the coding system (e.g. post-coordination).
# + system - The identification of the code system that defines the meaning of the symbol in the code.
# + userSelected - Indicates that this coding was chosen by a user directly - e.g. off a pick list of available items (codes or displays).
# + display - A representation of the meaning of the code in the system, following the rules of the system.
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + 'version - The version of the code system which was used when choosing this code. Note that a well-maintained code system does not need the version reported, because the meaning of codes is consistent across versions. However this cannot consistently be assured, and when the meaning is not guaranteed to be consistent, the version SHOULD be exchanged.

Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + security - Security labels applied to this resource. These tags connect specific resources to the overall security policy and infrastructure.
# + versionId - The version specific identifier, as it appears in the version portion of the URL. This value changes when the resource is created, updated, or deleted.
# + profile - A list of profiles (references to [StructureDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/structuredefinition.html#) resources) that this resource claims to conform to. The URL is a reference to [StructureDefinition.url](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/structuredefinition-definitions.html#StructureDefinition.url).
# + id - Unique id for the element within a resource (for internal references). This may be any string value that does not contain spaces.
# + 'source - A uri that identifies the source system of the resource. This provides a minimal amount of [Provenance](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/provenance.html#) information that can be used to track or differentiate the source of information in the resource. The source may identify another FHIR server, document, message, database, etc.
# + tag - Tags applied to this resource. Tags are intended to be used to identify and relate resources to process and workflow, and applications are not required to consider the tags when interpreting the meaning of a resource.
