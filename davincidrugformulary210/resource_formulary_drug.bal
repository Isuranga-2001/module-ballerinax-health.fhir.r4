# FHIR FormularyDrug resource record.
#
# + resourceType - The type of the resource describes
# + extension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension.
# + code - A code that specifies this medication, or a textual description if no code is available. Usage note: This could be a standard medication code such as a code from RxNorm, SNOMED CT, IDMP etc. It could also be a national or local formulary code, optionally with translations to other code systems.
# + modifierExtension - May be used to represent additional information that is not part of the basic definition of the resource and that modifies the understanding of the element that contains it and/or the understanding of the containing element's descendants. Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and manageable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer is allowed to define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions. Modifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).
# + regulatory - Regulatory information about a medication.
# + medicineClassification - Categorization of the medication within a formulary or classification system.
# + associatedMedication - Associated or related medications. For example, if the medication is a branded product (e.g. Crestor), this is the Therapeutic Moeity (e.g. Rosuvastatin) or if this is a generic medication (e.g. Rosuvastatin), this would link to a branded product (e.g. Crestor).
# + language - The base language in which the resource is written.
# + manufacturer - Describes the details of the manufacturer of the medication product. This is not intended to represent the distributor of a medication product.
# + synonym - Additional names for a medication, for example, the name(s) given to a medication in different countries. For example, acetaminophen and paracetamol or salbutamol and albuterol.
# + id - The logical id of the resource, as used in the URL for the resource. Once assigned, this value never changes.
# + text - A human-readable narrative that contains a summary of the resource and can be used to represent the content of the resource to a human. The narrative need not encode all the structured data, but is required to contain sufficient detail to make it 'clinically safe' for a human to just read the narrative. Resource definitions may define what content should be represented in the narrative to ensure clinical safety.
# + relatedMedicationKnowledge - Associated or related knowledge about a medication.
# + productType - Category of the medication or product (e.g. branded product, therapeutic moeity, generic product, innovator product, etc.).
# + administrationGuidelines - Guidelines for the administration of the medication.
# + contraindication - Potential clinical issue with or between medication(s) (for example, drug-drug interaction, drug-disease contraindication, drug-allergy interaction, etc.).
# + amount - Specific amount of the drug in the packaged product. For example, when specifying a product that has the same strength (For example, Insulin glargine 100 unit per mL solution for injection), this attribute provides additional clarification of the package amount (For example, 3 mL, 10mL, etc.).
# + intendedRoute - The intended or approved route of administration.
# + cost - The price of the medication.
# + ingredient - Identifies a particular constituent of interest in the product.
# + preparationInstruction - The instructions for preparing the medication.
# + packaging - Information that only applies to packages (not products).
# + monitoringProgram - The program under which the medication is reviewed.
# + contained - These resources do not have an independent existence apart from the resource that contains them - they cannot be identified independently, and nor can they have their own independent transaction scope.
# + drugCharacteristic - Specifies descriptive properties of the medicine, such as color, shape, imprints, etc.
# + doseForm - Describes the form of the item. Powder; tablets; capsule.
# + meta - The metadata about the resource. This is content that is maintained by the infrastructure. Changes to the content might not always be associated with version changes to the resource.
# + monograph - Associated documentation about the medication.
# + implicitRules - A reference to a set of rules that were followed when the resource was constructed, and which must be understood when processing the content. Often, this is a reference to an implementation guide that defines the special rules along with other profiles etc.
# + kinetics - The time course of drug absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of a medication from the body.
# + status - A code to indicate if the medication is in active use. The status refers to the validity about the information of the medication and not to its medicinal properties.
